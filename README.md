# NHTSA_2020_Road_Fatalities

## Project Context
This repository is the detail of the work I completed for a Data Science assignement, the assignment goal was to use open data to tell a story using R. The data selected was 2020 NHTSA Crash Data to show road safety differences in different US states.

## Data
The data was pre-processed and cleansed on Alteryx prior to being utilised for this project. 

The data sources are as follows:
* NHTSA Fatality Analysis Reporting System: https://www.nhtsa.gov/crash-data-systems/fatality-analysis-reporting-system
* State Infastructure Spending: https://taxfoundation.org/state-infrastructure-spending
* US Population by State: https://state.1keydata.com/state-population.php and https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/district-of-columbia-population-change-between-census-decade.html

## R Shiny App
The app url is https://wm8awn-samuel-muisyo.shinyapps.io/nhtsa_2020_road_fatalities/, this app was designed to fit a 1080p screen without needing to scroll.
